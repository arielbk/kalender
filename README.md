# Kalender

## What is it?

Kalender is a web app built with Python, using Flask as a micro-framework.

It is essentially a calendar, with the ability to log in and add notes to specific dates.

It is my first full-stack web app. I chose a project like this because it is challenging enough to keep me interested, accessible enough for me to finish, but open to add more and more features to as I go along.

I am doing this project for [Harvard's CS50x online course on EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). In the second to last week of the course we worked on a flask-based web app called CS50 finance, and that gave me some practice with using Python and Flask specifically.

## Why 'Kalender'?

Kalender is the German word for 'calendar'. It was my placeholder name for the project and it stuck.

## Who to thank

CS50 has been the best online course I have taken. It introduced me to programming and computer science principles and really introduced me to this world. This project is my final one for CS50.

I followed a video by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) which outlined creating a basic Flask app from scratch, and it was really helpful to get a grasp of many of the concepts. Most of the plugins I use in the app are directly from this short series, which were really helpful and insightful to follow along with before I dove into this project (which seemed daunting to me to begin with!). I have since watched a couple of other videos from him and they are really helpful and accessible for someone starting out in web development.
